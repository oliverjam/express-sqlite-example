# Express SQLite example

This is an example of how I'd set up a basic Express + SQLite app.

## DB setup

The SQLite connection is defined in `src/database/db.js`. This will read the `DB_FILE` environment variable and connect to the corresponding DB (or create a new one if it doesn't exist). It will also run the statements in `src/database/schema.sql` to ensure the DB contains the right tables.

This DB setup happens whenever the server starts, so make sure the `schema.sql` commands are safe to be re-run.

You can seed the DB with some example values by running `npm run seed`. This will execute the commands in `src/database/seed.sql`, which will insert some data.

The local `dev` npm script sets `DB_FILE` to `db.sqlite`, which is listed in the `.gitignore` so each local user can have their own copy of the DB.

## Deployment

Make sure you set the `DB_FILE` env var in your production environment. This might need to be in a specific directory (e.g. on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) only the `.data/` directory is persisted).

> [!Important]
> Most "Platform-as-a-service" hosts like Heroku are "ephemeral"â€”they recreate your app every time you deploy (and sometimes more often). This means the filesystem does not persist and your data will be lost.
> 
> SQLite should be used with platforms that either allow attaching a persistent volume (like [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/)), or just give you full control over the computer you're deploying to.
